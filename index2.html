            <h3><b><i>Shivaji Maharaj won his first fort, Torna Fort in 1645, when he was just 16 years old. Thus, he had finally initiated his military leading career with the expansion of the Maratha Empire. It was in the hands of Adil Shahi Sultanate of Bijapur during those times.Torna Fort gained much significance due to the fact that Shivaji found hidden treasure during its capture and utilized the same for building and strengthening his forces. Such success gave him the motivation to capture several other forts in the region, thus laying the foundation for his later conquests. He was joined in this and other early military enterprises by a small band of devoted companions, including Tanaji Malusare and Yesaji Kank. </i></b></h3>
